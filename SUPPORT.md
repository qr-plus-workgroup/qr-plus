# Support

Thank you for participating in the QR+ Proof of Standard testing program! This document explains how to get help with implementation questions, troubleshooting, and reporting issues.

## Getting Help

### ü§î I have a question about implementation

**‚Üí [Start a Discussion in Q&A](../../discussions/new?category=q-a)**

The Q&A category is perfect for:
- "How do I implement X?"
- "What's the correct way to Y?"
- "Which approach should I use for Z?"
- Understanding specification details

**Tips for getting good answers:**
- Be specific about what you're trying to accomplish
- Include relevant code snippets or API calls
- Mention the sandbox version you're using
- Describe what you've already tried
- Mark the answer that solves your problem

### üö® I'm stuck and don't know what's wrong

**‚Üí [Start a Discussion in Troubleshooting](../../discussions/new?category=troubleshooting)**

The Troubleshooting category is for:
- "I'm getting an error and don't know why"
- "Something isn't working as expected"
- "I'm not sure if this is a bug or my mistake"

**Tips for effective troubleshooting:**
- Describe what you expect to happen
- Describe what's actually happening
- Include error messages (full text)
- Share request/response examples (sanitize sensitive data)
- Specify sandbox and spec versions
- Be open to user error - that's okay!

We'll help you diagnose the root cause. If it turns out to be a bug or standard gap, we'll convert it to an issue for tracking.

### üêõ I found a clear bug or standard gap

**‚Üí [Create an Issue](../../issues/new/choose)**

If you've already identified a specific problem, create an issue using the appropriate template:

- **Standard Gap** - Missing capability that blocks your use case
- **Standard Ambiguity** - Specification is unclear or contradictory
- **Enhancement** - Nice-to-have improvement (workarounds exist)
- **Bug** - Sandbox implementation doesn't match specification
- **Documentation** - Documentation needs improvement

See our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidance on choosing the right issue type.

### üí¨ I want to discuss use cases or share ideas

**‚Üí [Start a Discussion in Use Cases or General](../../discussions)**

- **Use Cases** - Discuss implementation scenarios and approaches
- **General** - Open-ended conversations about the standard

### üìö I need reference documentation

**Resources:**
- **This Repository:** Browse [Issues](../../issues) and [Discussions](../../discussions) for past Q&A
- **Sandbox Demo:** [URL when available]
- **API Documentation:** [URL when available]
- **QR+ Specification:** [URL when available]

## Before Creating New Content

### Search First

Before asking a question or reporting an issue:

1. **Search [Discussions](../../discussions)** - Your question may already be answered
2. **Search [Issues](../../issues)** - The bug/gap may already be reported
3. **Check [Project Board](../../projects)** - See what's in progress

If you find something similar:
- üëç Use reactions to show you're affected
- üí¨ Add your specific details as a comment
- üîó Reference it if creating related content

### Check Documentation

- **README:** [Main overview](README.md)
- **Contributing Guide:** [Participation guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- **CLAUDE.md:** [Repository structure and workflows](CLAUDE.md) (for AI assistants)

**Urgency:** If something is blocking critical testing:
1. Mark it as `priority: high` (or request this in the issue)
2. Provide detailed context about the blocking impact
3. We'll prioritize accordingly

## Escalation

If you're not getting the help you need:

1. **First:** Add a comment requesting attention
2. **Then:** Contact repository owner/moderator directly: [Contact info]
