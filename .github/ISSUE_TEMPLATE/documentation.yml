      placeholder: |
        Example: The API reference shows a `merchantId` field as required, but the example paylink doesn't include it. This is confusing - is it required or optional?

      required: true

  - type: textarea
    id: expected-docs
    attributes:
      label: What Should It Say?
      description: What information should be included or corrected?
      placeholder: |
        Example: Documentation should clarify:
        1. Whether merchantId is required or optional
        2. Update example to include it if required
        3. Or explain why example omits it if optional
    validations:
      required: true

        Example: New implementers are confused about whether to include merchantId. Some are getting validation errors, others succeed without it. Leads to trial-and-error implementation.

        {
          \"merchantId\": \"merchant-123\",
          \"amount\": 10000,
