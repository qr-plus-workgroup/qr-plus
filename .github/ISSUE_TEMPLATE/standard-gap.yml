        ## Standard Gap - Missing Capability

        Use this template when the QR+ standard **cannot** support a required capability for your use case.

        **Examples of Standard Gaps:**
        - "No way to express partial refunds"
        - "Cannot represent multi-currency transactions"
        - "No mechanism for recurring payment authorization"
        - "Missing required field for VAT compliance"

        **Not a Standard Gap?** If workarounds exist, use **Enhancement** instead.

        **Not sure?** Start a [Discussion](https://github.com/qr-plus-workgroup/qr-plus/discussions/new?category=q-a) and we'll help you diagnose.

      label: Use Case
      description: What are you trying to accomplish? Describe your business scenario.
      placeholder: |
        Example: We need to process subscription payments where the payer authorizes recurring charges for a specific amount on a monthly basis.

      label: What's Missing?
      description: What capability does the standard lack? Be specific about what you need.
      placeholder: |
        Example: The standard has no way to indicate that a payment authorization is for recurring use. There's no field to specify:
        - Recurrence frequency (monthly, weekly, etc.)
        - Authorization expiry date
        - Maximum per-transaction amount
    validations:
      required: true

      label: Workarounds Attempted
      description: Have you tried any workarounds? Why don't they work?
      placeholder: |
        Example: Tried using memo field for metadata, but it's not structured and receivers can't reliably parse it. Tried external coordination, but violates standard's goal of self-contained paylinks.

      options:
        - "Completely blocks implementation"

      description: If you've reviewed the specification, which sections relate to this gap?
      placeholder: |
        Example: Reviewed section 4.2 (Payment Details) and section 5.1 (Authorization) - neither supports recurring payments.

    attributes:
      label: Proposed Solution (Optional)
      description: Do you have ideas for how the standard could address this gap?
      placeholder: |
        Example: Could add optional fields to payment authorization:
        - `recurrence`: { frequency, startDate, endDate }
        - `recurringMaxAmount`: Maximum per transaction
        - `recurringTotalAuth`: Total authorization across all transactions
